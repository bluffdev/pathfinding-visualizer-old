# Pathfinding Visualizer
This is a pathfinding visualizer inspired by the one made by Clement, the AlgoExpert guy. Try the live version here: [Pathfinding Visualizer](https://landoniwnl.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/). Also, check out the source code for Clement's visualizer here: https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer

# Future Plans
Currently, this visualizer only implements breadth-first-search. I have plans to add some other pathfinding algorithms and some maze generation algorithms in the future
